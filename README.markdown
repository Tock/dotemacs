# My .emacs setup.

> This readme is horribly outdated, but I can't be assed to update it now.
Basically what this repo contains in general configuration things. Mostly centered around emacs.


Things included:

* Obviously, my emacs configuration.

* Various colour themes.

* flymake/pylint setup. Move exec script somewhere 
  into your path and install flymake and pylint.

* Some programming fonts I use.

* Xresources with setup for emacs and urxvt

* Eh, other (less interesting) things.
